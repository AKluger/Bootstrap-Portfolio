                 <p>Originally trained as a jazz musician, I now channel my inner creative in the world of web-development.  I see beauty in simplicity and always aim to write code that is both elegant and efficient.  I never tire of learning and love to incorporate the latest developments in tech to my projects.  Formerly self-taught, I have now augmented my skills with the cutting-edge curriculum of UPenn's fullstack coding bootcamp.   
                </p>
    
                <p>My aim is to leverage my experience managing operations and small teams in a fast-paced hospitality environment to proactively implementing clever software solutions for businesses large and small.  Specifically, I see the healthcare industry as having tremendous room for improvement in user experience from administrator down the line to end consumer.  As we collect more and more data, it will be vital to connect these resources with an intuitive interface so healthcare providers and insurers may be more effective in providing necessary treatments.
                </p>
    
                <p>I currently reside in Philadelphia, PA.  Most days you will find me at my desk coding out my latest project.  When not at home, I enjoy exploring the city by bicycle and savoring all the local goodies such as brews and coffee.</p>
