            <p>Originally trained as a jazz musician, I now channel my inner creative in the world of web-development.  I see beauty in simplicity and always aim to write code that is both elegant and efficient.  I never tire of learning and love to incorporate the latest developments in tech to my projects.  Formerly self-taught, I have now augmented my skills with the cutting-edge curriculum of Upenn's fullstack coding bootcamp.   I believe that as a developer it is vital to contribute to the open-source community and have found it rewarding from the start.  I would not have had the perseverence to build my business without the support of the Github community. 
            </p>
            <p>I currently reside in Philadelphia, PA.  With work experience performing and operating the front-of-house in various cafes, I now enjoy my role behind-the-scenes as a coder.  Most days you will find me at my desk listening to music, watching the stock market, and scanning my twitter feed.  When not at home, I enjoy exploring the city by bicycle and savoring all the local goodies such as local beer and coffee.</p>
